# Escrow Contract

The Escrow Contract is a smart contract designed to facilitate secure and trustless transactions between two parties. It acts as an intermediary, holding funds in escrow until specific conditions are met, providing an additional layer of security and transparency to the transaction process.

## Features

- Allows two parties to engage in a secure transaction with funds held in escrow.
- The contract includes a public, payable constructor to set the initial state and define the transaction details.
- Provides an external function for the payer to deposit funds into the escrow.
- Provides an external function for the payee to release the funds once the conditions are met.
- Includes a fallback function to reject any direct incoming payments.

## Contract Security

To ensure secure and reliable transaction handling, the Escrow Contract implements the following security measures:

- Only the payer can deposit funds into the contract.
- The payee can only release the funds once the predefined conditions are met.
- The fallback function rejects any direct incoming payments, preventing accidental loss of funds.

## Usage

1. Deploy the Escrow Contract on the Ethereum network.
2. Set the payer, payee, and any predefined conditions for fund release using the constructor.
3. The payer deposits the agreed-upon funds into the escrow using the provided deposit function.
4. Once the conditions are met, the payee can initiate the release of funds using the release function.
5. In case of any disputes or issues, both parties can engage in an arbitration process or seek legal advice.

Please note that this is a basic implementation of an escrow contract and may require additional modifications or enhancements based on your specific use case. It is recommended to thoroughly review and test the contract before deploying it to the Ethereum network.
